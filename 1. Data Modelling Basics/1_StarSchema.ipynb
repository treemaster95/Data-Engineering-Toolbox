    "# Star Schema Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Star Schema is a database schema that is optimized for querying and reporting. It consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The fact table contains the measures, metrics, or facts of a business process (e.g., sales amount, quantity), and it is surrounded by dimension tables which contain the context (e.g., date, product, customer) of the facts and measures in the fact table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of Star Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fact Table**: Central table in a star schema. It contains quantitative data for analysis.\n",
    "- **Dimension Tables**: Satellite tables linked to the fact table. They contain descriptive attributes related to the facts (e.g., time, items, location).\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema is called a \"star schema\" because the diagram of such a database resembles a star, with points radiating from a center. The center represents the fact table and the points represent the dimension tables.\n",

    "Consider a sales system where the fact table records sales transactions. This fact table, `SalesFact`, might include columns for the date of sale, product ID, customer ID, quantity of items sold, and total sale amount. Dimension tables could include `DateDim` (with date, day, month, year), `ProductDim` (with product ID, name, category), and `CustomerDim` (with customer ID, name, contact details).\n",
