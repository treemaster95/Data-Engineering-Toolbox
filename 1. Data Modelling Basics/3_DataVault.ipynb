    "\n",
    "The Data Vault modeling approach is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming from multiple operational systems. It is detail-oriented, highly scalable, and built to handle the complexities of big data and real-time data integration in a historically traceable and auditable manner.\n",

    "## Components of Data Vault Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hubs**: These tables store unique business keys, representing core business concepts (e.g., customers, products).\n",
    "- **Links**: These tables store associations or transactions between business keys, essentially capturing the relationships between Hubs.\n",
    "- **Satellites**: These tables store the descriptive attributes, context, and historical changes associated with the Hubs or Links.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is highly flexible and allows for the easy addition of new sources and changes in business processes without disrupting existing models.\n",

    "- **Links** to represent transactions, such as a Sales Link (`LinkSales`) connecting customers, products, and dates.\n",
    "- **Satellites** to capture all the descriptive, changing details about these entities, like customer demographics (`SatCustomerDetails`) or product descriptions (`SatProductDetails`).\n",
